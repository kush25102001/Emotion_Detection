😄 Emotion Detection using NLP
A Natural Language Processing project to detect the emotional sentiment behind a user-provided sentence. The system classifies text into one of several emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise.

📌 Problem Statement
Understanding human emotions in text is essential for improving chatbots, mental health monitoring, and user experience. This project aims to detect emotions from sentences using a machine learning approach.

🧠 Approach
Dataset: Emotion Dataset (Kaggle)

Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stopword removal

Vectorization: TF-IDF

Model Used: Logistic Regression (can be swapped with others like SVM, Naive Bayes)

Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NLTK

Matplotlib (for performance visualization)

🚀 How to Run
bash

cd emotion-detector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main program
